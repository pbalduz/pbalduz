### Hi there, I'm Pablo 👋

I'm an iOS dev based in Barcelona ☀️ passionate about building stuff for Apple's ecosystem. I also like to keep it active so whenever I'm not coding you will find me on the court 🏀 or at the gym 🏋🏽

I enjoy attending tech conferences and once had the chance to participate in NSSpain with a [lightning talk](https://vimeo.com/showcase/9831667/video/751538676). Hopefully there are more to come!

Also I'm always learning and experimenting so if you have something cool to share let's connect and create something awesome together! 😎
